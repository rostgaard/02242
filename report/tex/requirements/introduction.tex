\section{Introduction}
Program analysis is the discipline of extracting and deriving information about the structure, and potential behaviour of computer programs. It has many applications, such as; bug finding, optimizations, code reuse, formal validation and model mapping. In this report, we take a closer look at some of the specialized and general theory used for transforming source code text into analysis-friendly structures, and then performing the actual analysis on them.
