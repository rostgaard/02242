\section{Implementation}
We have chosen Java as our implementation language and ANTLR as our framework for constructing a lexer and a parser.

As described in section \ref{sec:constructing_flow_graphs} we use an unbalanced tree for containing our abstract syntax tree, which serves as our intermediate representation (IR).

\subsection{Function mapping}
